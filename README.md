Transform your rough shoe sketches into realistic images using cutting-edge AI powered by Pix2Pix GANs and TensorFlow.
# 🖌️ Pix2Pix AI – Sketch to Shoe Generator

Transform your rough shoe sketches into photorealistic footwear using the power of AI! This project utilizes a **Pix2Pix GAN** trained on the `edges2shoes` dataset to generate realistic shoes from input sketches, all wrapped in a clean Flask web interface with a Material Design-inspired frontend.

---

## 🔍 Overview

Pix2Pix AI Generator is a deep learning application that takes in edge-drawn sketches of shoes and generates realistic outputs using trained GAN models. The interface allows users to upload a sketch, and instantly view results generated by both the **final model** and the **best-performing model checkpoint**.

## 🚀 Features

- 🖼️ Upload shoe sketches in PNG or JPG
- ⚡ Instant output using trained GANs
- 🤖 View outputs from multiple model versions
- 💡 Responsive and aesthetic frontend
- 🔒 Offline, privacy-respecting model inference

## 🧠 Model Access

⚠️ The trained AI models (`generator_final.h5` and `generator_epoch_24.h5`) are **not included** in this repository due to file size restrictions.
